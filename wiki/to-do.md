* Better sorting of menu items and a function to pin items to top. Currently items are sorted by their names. Items beginning with a capital letter are shown on top, so `Z` goes before `a`. Kinda weird.
* ~~HTML title is `IOTA Wiki` everywhere. Really bad. It should contain the title of the current page too. Users should be able to define metatags on their pages.~~ [done](https://github.com/iotapizza/wiki-engine/commit/f0406733159a52f6de058488b2451c548b26115b)
* Improve readability of text (increase font size) as well as usability of the wiki. Especially the menu and general navigation within the wiki should be made more user friendly.
* Improve upload and image handling. Add versioning and proper access rights management for files and images.
