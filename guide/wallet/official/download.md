# Download wallet
The official IOTA GUI wallet is available for download on GitHub. You will always find the latest release on top of the following page.

**Download location:** [https://github.com/iotaledger/wallet/releases](https://github.com/iotaledger/wallet/releases)

The latest release while writing this guide is **v2.5.1**. If there is a newer version you will find it at the location above.

Find and download the correct build for your operating system:
* **Windows users** need the `IOTA.Wallet.Setup.x.x.x.exe`,
* **Mac users** need to download `IOTA.Wallet-x.x.x.dmg`.

Builds for other operating systems and the source code are available too.

Make sure to use **always the latest version**! The wallet does not have an automated update mechanism. In order to avoid problems it is strongly advised to **check for new releases and other announcements regularly**.

# Install & update
After you have downloaded the wallet you can verify the integrity of the file using the checksums provided at the download location. This is an **optional step**.

Start the installation process that will install the IOTA wallet and its prerequisites to your system.

If you are **upgrading from an earlier release** you only have to install the newer version over the existing one. As you only need your [seeds](/guide/wallet/official/download) in order to access your wallets (and IOTA balances) from anywhere in the world, it is usually **not necessary to make backups**.

It is of **utmost importance** to fully understand [how seeds work](/guide/wallet/official/seeds) **before** sending any IOTA to your wallet in order to avoid **financial loss**!
