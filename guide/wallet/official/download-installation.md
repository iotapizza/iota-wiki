# Download
The IOTA GUI wallet is available for download on GitHub. You will always find the latest release on top of the following page.

> **Download page:** [https://github.com/iotaledger/wallet/releases](https://github.com/iotaledger/wallet/releases)

The latest release while writing this guide is **v2.5.1**. If there's a newer version you will find it at the download location above.

Download the correct build for your operating system:
* **Windows users** need the `IOTA.Wallet.Setup.x.x.x.exe`,
* **Mac users** need to download the `IOTA.Wallet-x.x.x.dmg` file.
* Builds for other operating systems and the wallet source code are available too.

**Always use the latest version!** The wallet does **not** have an automated update mechanism. In order to avoid problems it is strongly advised to **check for new releases and other announcements** regularly.

# Installation & update
After you have downloaded the wallet you can verify the integrity of the file using the checksums provided at the download page. This is an optional step.

Then **start the installation process** (execute the file) that will install the IOTA wallet and its prerequisites to your system.

If you are **upgrading** from an earlier release you can just install the new version over the existing one (unless stated otherwise in the release notes). Since you only need your seeds to access your wallets (and IOTA balances) from any device in the world, it is usually not necessary to make backups of the wallet itself.

It is of **utmost importance** to fully understand [how seeds work](/guide/wallet/official/seeds) **before** sending any IOTA to your wallet in order to avoid **financial loss**!
