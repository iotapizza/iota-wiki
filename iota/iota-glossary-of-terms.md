# Motivation
Diving into IOTA can be overwhelming. In the early days of a massive undertaking like IOTA, the available documentation is scattered, sparse and tends to be mostly technical. Developers, who have to deal with lots of competing priorities, will likely not be focused on exhaustive documentation.

In order to facilitate learning, having a clear and precise understanding of the terms which form the IOTA universe, is essential.

This IOTA Glossary of Terms aims at providing you just that. It has been initiated by Ralf Rottmann, available on the official IOTA Slack and Twitter as [@ralf](https://twitter.com/ralf).
